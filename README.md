# Igor Roslyakov — Technical Writing Portfolio

### About me
Technical writer focused on developer documentation and Python education.

### Documentation projects:

## 🟢 Webhook Receiver Onboarding Template

Onboarding documentation template for a backend webhook receiver, including 
minimal FastAPI implementation, architecture notes, and operational runbooks.

**Audience:** Backend engineers joining a team, junior to mid-level, who need 
to understand how a webhook-based service works and how to contribute to it.  
**Focus:** 
1. Onboarding documentation structure.
2. Clarity of technical explanations.
3. Documentation of common backend concerns:
   1. request handling;
   2. security assumptions;
   3. idempotency;
   4. operational troubleshooting.

## 🟢 Dockerized Backend Development Environment

Documentation-driven template for a local backend development environment
built with Docker Compose. The project demonstrates how developer-facing
documentation supports onboarding, environment setup, and day-to-day
development for backend services.

The repository includes a minimal FastAPI-based API service, a background
worker, PostgreSQL, Redis, and supporting documentation explaining how the
system is structured, started, debugged, and operated locally.

**Audience:** Backend engineers and new team members who need to run and
understand a multi-service backend system locally.

**Focus:**
1. Developer onboarding for local environments.
2. Documentation of Docker and Docker Compose usage in backend teams.
3. Explanation of service interactions:
   1. API → database persistence;
   2. API → queue-based background processing;
   3. worker-based task execution.
4. Operational documentation:
   1. health checks;
   2. debugging workflows;
   3. common local development pitfalls;
   4. runbooks for typical failure scenarios.
